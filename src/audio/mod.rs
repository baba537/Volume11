//! Audio layer.
//!
//! All COM/WASAPI work happens on one dedicated thread owned by [`AudioHandle`].
//! The UI never touches COM: it sends [`Command`]s and receives [`Event`]s.
//!
//! Two design points carried over deliberately from reviewing the old WPF version:
//!
//! 1. Session objects are **cached** in a map keyed by process id. Moving a slider
//!    is an O(1) lookup plus a single COM call, not a full session re-enumeration.
//! 2. Changes are **event driven** (`IAudioSessionNotification`, `IAudioSessionEvents`,
//!    `IMMNotificationClient`). There is no polling timer, so switching the default
//!    playback device or changing a level elsewhere is reflected immediately.
