/// Windows ships no OpenGL beyond version 1.1; anything higher comes from the GPU
/// vendor's driver. A machine running on the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter — a
/// fresh install, a VM, some remote sessions — therefore has no usable OpenGL at
/// all, which is why the GL renderer was dropped.
///
/// Direct3D 12 is a first-class Windows API with a guaranteed software fallback
/// (WARP), and on a normal desktop it is also the faster path, because D3D12
/// drivers get far more attention on Windows than OpenGL ones do.
///
/// Vulkan was enabled alongside it at first and has been dropped again: measured
/// against a build with D3D12 alone it cost 44 MB of working set, 123 handles and
/// 9 threads at startup for a backend Windows never picks when D3D12 is present.
