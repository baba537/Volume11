# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-24

### Added
- Output device switcher: click the device name above the mixer. Each device
  keeps its own saved levels, and switching applies that device's set.

### Changed
- Configuration format 2 stores levels per device. Levels saved by 0.1.0 move
  to the device in use at the first start.

### Fixed
- An autostart entry pointing at a deleted copy of Volume11 is repointed at the
  running one. The installer also adopts an existing entry.
- Program names read from an executable's version resource could end in
  garbage, e.g. "Spotify8?FileV".

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-21

First release.

- Per-application volume, stored by executable name and re-applied when a
  program starts playing
- Follows the default output device, event driven rather than polled
- Tray icon with mixer and settings; closing the window keeps it running
- Autostart, switchable from Task Manager
- True-black theme with seven accents, application icons read from the
  executables
- Installer with update and uninstall paths; the plain executable is attached
  for a portable copy
